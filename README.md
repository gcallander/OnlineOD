# OnlineOD: How to use these jupyter notebooks
This repository holds the data processing code for the ClampOD and TubeOD. These handy light scattering tools are great for measuring OD of thermophiles, anaerobes, or other systems where frequent manual sampling is inconvienent and/or hinders the quality of your data. Both the ClampOD and TubeOD are easy, inexpensive, and fast to assemble using the process outlined in the paper cited below. This code is included to guide anyone with minimal coding experience and to speed up the process of getting an Online OD device set up in your lab or classroom. 

The two main codes in this repo are detailed as follows:

OD-Meter-Matlab.ipynb includes the data processing code and the graphing code used for the publication. 

OD-Template.ipynb is a high level template that you can use to guide you through the data upload, calibration, and plotting process. This code is purely for ease of use but will not run until you have added your own data to the path.
